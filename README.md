# IP1 RESTClient
A PHP SDK for IP1's SMS services.

** Note: This package is in a beta stage and it's not recommended for use in production **

## Getting Started
### Installing
Install using Composer.
```json
{
  "require": {
    "ip1sms/phprestclient": "*"
  }
}
```
### Getting API Credentials
Create a free test-account at:

[app.ip1sms.com](https://app.ip1sms.com/account/signup?l=en)

Then log in at this [link](https://app.ip1sms.com/account/) using the credentials sent to the phone number provided via SMS.
Once logged in click on ``Settings`` and then ``SMS Gateway API`` and you will be presented in the left panel with an account ID. The API Key will be sent to the phone number provided on registration when the ``Send API Key`` is clicked.

### Basic Usage
###### Sending a text message.
```php
<?php
use IP1\RESTClient\SMS\OutGoingSMS;
use IP1\RESTClient\Core\Communicator;

$com = new Communicator("{account-id}", "{apiKey}");
$sms = new OutGoingSMS("{nameOrNumber}", "IP1 SMS is the best!");
$sms->addNumber("{aPhoneNumber}");
$com->add($sms);
```
###### Adding a contact and then editing it.
```php
<?php
use IP1\RESTClient\Recipient\Contact;
use IP1\RESTClient\Recipient\ProcessedContact;
use IP1\RESTClient\Core\Communicator;

$com = new Communicator("{accountID}", "{apiKey}");
$contact = new Contact("Jack", "{aPhoneNumber}");
$contact = $com->add($contact);

$contact->setEmail("jack@example.org");
$com->edit($contact);
```
